# Color Method

Use this reference when you need more concrete help than the main skill provides.

## 1. Read Color As Behavior

Before proposing any values, ask what color is supposed to do here.

Color may be carrying one or more of these jobs:
- atmosphere
- hierarchy
- action emphasis
- status and recovery
- navigation and current state
- category separation
- trust and seriousness
- warmth or approachability

Most interfaces fail when one color is trying to do too many jobs at once.

## 1.5 Appropriateness Principle

An effective color system fits the product, the audience, and the situation of use.

Ask:
- does this feel appropriate for this interface?
- does it support the trust level, energy, and seriousness the product needs?
- does it feel right for the audience and context, not just attractive in isolation?

Fit beats abstract theory. A palette can be harmonious and still feel wrong.

## 2. Describe The System Before You Build It

Write a plain-language brief first. A good brief sounds like:

- the interface should feel calm and exact, not cold
- most of the UI should stay neutral
- emphasis should be rare and confident
- warnings should feel serious without reading as catastrophic
- selected state should be clearer than info state

This description matters more than the first batch of values.

If the output keeps drifting toward generic design language, add a short avoid list as well:

- avoid feeling childish
- avoid startup-gradient cliches
- avoid washed-out enterprise grayness
- avoid decorative color that competes with the content

## 3. Relationship Grammar

Think in these relationships instead of preset palette types.

### Neutral backbone

- What color family should hold the majority of surfaces?
- Should it feel cool, warm, dry, soft, clinical, paper-like, inky, mineral, electric?
- How much hue bias can it carry before it starts becoming atmospheric noise?

### Emphasis distribution

- Where should the eye go first?
- How much of the interface is allowed to feel "active" at once?
- Which elements deserve the strongest contrast or chroma?

### Semantic distance

- How distinct should success, warning, danger, info, selected, and primary feel?
- Which distinctions matter most for this interface?
- Which states may share family resemblance and which must never collide?

Not every interface needs a large semantic state system. Some are organized more by atmosphere, emphasis, and brand than by status colors.

### State motion

Describe how a state should change, not only what color it should be.

Examples:
- hover gets slightly lighter and clearer
- active gets deeper and firmer
- disabled loses chroma and contrast together
- selected gets stronger separation from its surroundings but does not become a warning

### Theme relationship

If multiple themes exist, decide the relationship between them.

- Are they twins with different lightness structure?
- Is dark mode intentionally quieter and less saturated?
- Which emotional qualities must remain constant across themes?

## 3.5 Category Fit And Differentiation

Look at the visual territory around the product.

- What colors does the category repeatedly use?
- Which of those conventions help trust and recognition?
- Where is there room to differentiate without feeling inappropriate?

Differentiation is not mandatory. Sometimes familiarity is the right move. The important part is to choose consciously.

## 4. Use Color Math Where It Helps

Reason in `OKLCH` or another perceptual color space when possible.

Useful mental model:
- lightness = structure
- chroma = loudness
- hue = direction

Do not memorize exact numbers unless needed. The point is to think perceptually and adjust intentionally.

## 5. Scripts As A Color Workbench

Small deterministic scripts are helpful when the model knows what it wants but should not improvise the mechanics.

A helper script is optional. If the task is exploratory, highly taste-driven, or very small, reasoning and visual critique may be enough.

Good helper scripts:

### Ramp generator

Input:
- one or more anchor colors
- desired lightness range
- desired chroma behavior

Output:
- tonal variants or role candidates

Use when the relationship is known but the exact ladder should not be guessed freehand.

### Foreground pairing checker

Input:
- candidate surface colors
- contrast target

Output:
- likely text/icon colors and failures

Use when adding tinted surfaces, badges, alerts, hero sections, or soft state fills.

### State derivation helper

Input:
- a base color
- preferred movement rules for hover/active/disabled/selected

Output:
- deterministic variants to review and tune

Use when the desired behavior is clear but consistency matters across many components.

### Collision audit

Input:
- primary, info, success, warning, danger, selected, and chart colors

Output:
- warnings when families are too similar in hue, lightness, or chroma

Use when a UI starts feeling semantically blurry.

### Drift audit

Input:
- design tokens, CSS variables, component files, or screenshots

Output:
- places where the implemented system no longer matches the intended logic

Use when the palette works in principle but the shipped UI feels inconsistent.

### Token metadata helper

Input:
- token or role definitions

Output:
- optional structured notes such as intended use, avoid cases, contrast expectations, and likely component bindings

Use when formalizing a system so future agents or developers apply it consistently.

## 6. What Scripts Should Not Decide

Do not hard-code design categories and let them choose the palette.
Do not let scripts choose the emotional tone.
Do not let scripts replace judgment about restraint, hierarchy, trust, or visual character.

Scripts are best at:
- interpolation
- validation
- comparison
- detection
- repeatability

They are not best at:
- deciding what the product should feel like
- deciding where emphasis belongs
- deciding whether a warning should feel tense or calm
- deciding whether a system feels too sterile, too playful, too loud, or too generic

## 6.5 First-Impression Check

Before detailed analysis, do a quick pass:

- what lands in the first two seconds?
- what seems primary?
- what emotional tone lands immediately?
- does that match the product's intended character?

This catches failures that a token-perfect system can still have.

## 7. Observe The System On Real Surfaces

Never stop at swatches.

Review the colors on:
- body text and dense copy
- buttons and links
- input fields and focus rings
- alerts, badges, and validation
- tables, lists, and row states
- overlays and modals
- charts, legends, and annotations
- both common and edge-case content lengths

The same colors behave differently when used as:
- thin border
- background fill
- text on a neutral surface
- text on a tinted surface
- compact badge
- large panel

## 8. Failure Modes

### Everything feels flat

Usually means weak lightness structure. Improve separation between canvas, surface, raised surface, border, and text before adding more hue.

### Everything feels loud

Usually means too much chroma is carrying too much of the system. Pull saturation back, reduce tinted surfaces, and concentrate emphasis.

### Everything feels bland

Often a hierarchy problem, not a palette problem. Clarify where emphasis belongs before introducing more colors.

### The system feels childish

Often caused by too many bright categories, playful saturation, or too many simultaneous accents.

### The system feels muddy

Often caused by insufficient lightness separation, too many low-contrast tinted surfaces, or dark themes with too much residual chroma.

### The system works in concept but not in code

Look for drift: hardcoded values, outdated component variants, new local exceptions, missing foreground pairings, or chart colors leaking into UI chrome.

### The system is technically correct but emotionally wrong

The numbers may be clean while the interface still feels generic, mismatched, or over-designed. Restate the intended feeling in plain language and compare the UI against that statement, not only against the tokens.

## 9. Review Loop

Use this loop when refining a system:

1. state the intended feeling in plain language
2. do the 2-second first-impression read
3. point to the current failure mode
4. decide whether the fix is judgmental or mechanical
5. if mechanical, use or write a helper script
6. review the result in real UI context
7. keep what improved the intended feeling; roll back what only made the numbers cleaner

## 10. Validation Checklist

Before shipping, verify:

- text contrast holds on every important surface
- interactive states remain understandable without relying only on hue
- emphasis is concentrated where it matters
- semantic colors remain separable
- the system feels appropriate to the product and audience
- any differentiation from category norms feels intentional rather than random
- dark theme is reviewed on its own terms if present
- the system still works on small components and dense layouts
- helper-script output still matches the intended feeling
- implemented components actually consume the shared logic

If the system only works as an abstract palette, it is not ready.
