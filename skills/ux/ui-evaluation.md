# UX Evaluation: 13 Dimensions

**Principle**: Fundamentals first, trends second. Master the basics before polish.

**Priority**: Always evaluate 1-10 first. Only evaluate 11-13 if relevant. "Ugly but works" beats "pretty but broken."

**Scoring**: Rate each dimension 1-5 (1=broken, 2=poor, 3=adequate, 4=good, 5=excellent).

**Lineage**: Dimensions 1-10 map to Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics. Dimensions 11-13 extend into modern product expectations.

## Part 1: Fundamental Building Blocks (Always Evaluate)

### 1. Can users accomplish their primary task?
*Nielsen: Visibility of system status / Match between system and real world*

The most important question — if this fails, nothing else matters.

- Primary goal obvious and achievable?
- All necessary actions/features present?
- Critical path unblocked?
- No dead ends?

### 2. Do users understand what to do?
*Nielsen: Match between system and real world / Recognition rather than recall*

Clarity and affordance — can users figure out the interface without instructions?

- Controls obviously clickable/interactive?
- Labels clear (not jargon or ambiguous)?
- Purpose of each section obvious?
- Call-to-action visible?
- Icons recognizable (or labeled)?

### 3. Do users get feedback when they act?
*Nielsen: Visibility of system status*

Feedback loops — users need to know their actions had effect.

- Button click gives immediate response (visual change, loading indicator)?
- Form submission shows confirmation?
- Changes persist (saved, not lost)?
- Loading states present?
- Error messages clear and actionable?
- Success confirmations present?

### 4. Can users find what they're looking for?
*Nielsen: Recognition rather than recall / Flexibility and efficiency of use*

Information architecture and navigation.

- Navigation structure logical?
- Labels match user mental model (not internal jargon)?
- Important content/features easy to locate?
- Search works (if present)?
- Content grouped sensibly?
- Breadcrumbs or wayfinding clear?

### 5. Is the interface consistent?
*Nielsen: Consistency and standards*

Internal consistency — predictability reduces cognitive load.

- Same action looks/works same everywhere?
- Terminology consistent ("Delete" vs "Remove" — pick one)?
- Button styles consistent (primary, secondary, tertiary)?
- Layout patterns repeated?
- Color meanings consistent (red = error, green = success)?
- Design tokens/system used (not hardcoded one-off colors/spacing)?

### 6. Does it reduce or create cognitive load?
*Nielsen: Aesthetic and minimalist design / Recognition rather than recall*

Simplicity and mental effort.

- Information presented clearly (not overwhelming)?
- Choices limited to reasonable number (not paralysis)?
- Visual hierarchy obvious (what's important)?
- Unnecessary elements removed?
- Related info grouped together?
- Progressive disclosure (advanced features hidden until needed)?

### 7. Can users recover from mistakes?
*Nielsen: Error prevention / Help users recognize, diagnose, recover from errors*

Error prevention and recovery.

- Destructive actions hard to trigger accidentally?
- Confirmations for dangerous operations (Delete, Clear)?
- Undo available for non-trivial actions?
- Input validation prevents errors (not just catches after)?
- Smart defaults reduce mistakes?
- Clear error messages with recovery path?

### 8. Can ALL users access this?
*Nielsen: Flexibility and efficiency of use (extended)*

Accessibility fundamentals — not about compliance, about usability for everyone.

- Keyboard navigation works (tab through everything)?
- Text readable (sufficient contrast, not too small)?
- Color not sole indicator (colorblind users)?
- Form inputs properly labeled?
- Screen readers can navigate (semantic HTML)?
- Focus indicators visible?

Minimum standard: WCAG 2.2 AA (4.5:1 contrast for text, 3:1 for UI elements)

### 9. Does it handle edge cases and states?
*Nielsen: Error prevention / Help and documentation*

Real users encounter edge cases constantly.

Check all states:
- Loading (not blank screen)
- Empty (first use, zero results — not broken-looking)
- Error (message + recovery, not cryptic)
- Success (confirmation)
- Partial data (incomplete results)
- Slow/timeout (doesn't hang forever)

Other edge cases:
- Very long text (does layout break?)
- Missing data (graceful degradation?)
- Network issues (offline handling?)

### 10. Does it respect user context and flow?
*Nielsen: User control and freedom*

Journey continuity — users don't start fresh every interaction.

- Where they came from (back button works correctly)?
- State persists across navigation (no data loss)?
- Unsaved changes warning present?
- Return to previous location (not dumped to home)?
- Context maintained (filters, selections preserved)?

## Part 2: Modern Expectations (Context-Dependent)

### 11. Does it meet performance expectations?

- Loads reasonably quickly (not >5s)?
- Responds to interactions (not laggy)?
- Large operations show progress?
- Images/media optimized?

If performance-critical (consumer web, mobile): LCP <2.5s, INP <200ms, CLS <0.1

### 12. Does it handle specific domain needs?

**Mobile apps**: Touch targets 44×44px minimum, one-handed use, discoverable gestures
**Data-heavy apps**: Search/filters effective, appropriate visualization, export/bulk ops
**Real-time/collaborative**: Updates appear promptly, conflicts handled, presence indicators
**AI-powered apps**: Suggestions helpful not annoying, overridable, failures handled
**Privacy-sensitive**: GDPR/CCPA consent, transparent data collection, no dark patterns

### 13. Does visual craft support usability?

Polish that serves function, not decoration.

- Typography: max 2 font families, line-height 1.4-1.6 for body text, clear size hierarchy
- Spacing: consistent scale (not arbitrary pixel values)
- Color: semantic tokens used, not hardcoded values; palette limited (3-5 core colors)
- Content: real/representative content, not lorem ipsum or empty placeholders
- Responsive: layout adapts to viewport (if web)
- Dark mode: available and tested (if consumer app)
- Animations: smooth and purposeful, not gratuitous (if present)

## Context Adjustments

| Context | Priority | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| B2B/Enterprise | Efficiency > delight | Data density OK, expert shortcuts critical |
| Consumer/Mobile | Simplicity, performance | Touch-first, polish matters |
| Internal Tools | Functionality > aesthetics | Can assume training |

## Anti-Patterns (Always Flag)

**Fundamental violations**: No way to complete task, broken navigation, blank error screens, keyboard traps
**Dark patterns**: Hidden opt-out, fake urgency, disguised ads, bait-and-switch
